# Food Order App

Made this project as my learning journey of React

## Functionalities
  * useEffect hook to execute function after the first render, to execute only once, or to dispose a functionality
  * useCallback hook to avoid recreating function that are sent to useEffect dependencies
  * create custom hook for handling sending requests
